In this paper, we provide two case studies to demonstrate how artificial intelligence can empower civil engineering. In the first case, a machine learning-assisted framework, BRAILS, is proposed for city-scale building information modeling. The second case focuses on the task of soft-story building classification. Through extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
