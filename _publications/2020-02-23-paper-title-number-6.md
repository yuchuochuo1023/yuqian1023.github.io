We investigate the problem of fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR), where free-hand human sketches are used as queries to perform instance-level retrieval of images. This is an extremely challenging task because (i) visual comparisons not only need to be fine-grained but also executed cross-domain,(ii) free-hand (finger) sketches are highly abstract, making fine-grained matching harder, and most importantly (iii) annotated cross-domain sketch-photo datasets required for training are scarce, challenging many state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. In this paper, for the first time, we address all these challenges, providing a step towards the capabilities that would underpin a commercial sketch-based image retrieval application.
