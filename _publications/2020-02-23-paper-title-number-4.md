In this paper, we argue that both high and mid-level features are relevant for cross-domain instance matching (CDIM). Importantly, mid-level features already exist in earlier layers of the DNN. They just need to be extracted, represented, and fused properly with the final layer. Based on this simple but powerful idea, we propose a unified framework for CDIM.
