Sketch-based image synthesis aims to generate a photo image given a sketch. It is a challenging task; because sketches are drawn by non-professionals and only consist of strokes, they usually exhibit shape deformation and lack visual cues, i.e., colors and textures. In this work, we show that the key to this task lies in decomposing the translation into two sub-tasks, shape translation and colorization. Correspondingly, we propose a model consisting of two sub-networks, with each one tackling one sub-task.
