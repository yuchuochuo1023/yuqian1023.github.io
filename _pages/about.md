I am an associate professor at the [School of Software Engineering, Beihang University](http://soft.buaa.edu.cn/). Before I joined Beihang, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at UC Berkeley / ICSI during 2018~2019, working with Prof. [Stella Yu](http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~stellayu/). I received my Ph.D. degree from QMUL-SketchX Lab in 2018, advised by Dr. [Yi-Zhe Song](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/Y.Song/) and Prof. [Tao Xiang](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/T.Xiang/index.html).

My research is on computer vision and deep learning, with a foucs on sketch understanding, like synthesis, recognition, and related applications.

I am actively looking for highly-motivated graduate students. If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree in computer vision, please send me an email [qianyu@buaa.edu.cn](qianyu@buaa.edu.cn).
