I am an associate professor at Beihang University. Before I joined Beihang, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at UC Berkeley / ICSI during 2018~2019, working with Prof. Stella Yu. I received my Ph.D. degree from QMUL-SketchX Lab in 2014, advised by Dr. Yi-Zhe Song and Prof. Tao Xiang. \n

My research interest focuses on sketch understanding, including recognition, retrieval, synthesis, and sketch-related applications. \n

I am actively looking for highly-motivated graduate students. If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree in computer vision, please send me an email qianyu@buaa.edu.cn. \n
